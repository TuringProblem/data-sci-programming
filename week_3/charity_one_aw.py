## In this assignment you are to write the code that will determine and output the following:
## - If all customers participate how much money will be raised?
## - if customers are 50% likely to participate
## hint: use the cieling of x: the smallest integer greatest than or equal to x.

def handle_money(min_amount=1.00, max_amount=100.00):
    customers = 10_000
    round(random.uniform(min_amount, max_amount), 2)
